# Excel-functions
This project utilised various functions within Excel to explore the dataset.

1. Add all the available data between the columns A–H into a table.

   This organised the dataset into a structured and accessible format, making it easier to apply functions.

2. Filter 'Age' to 'largest to smallest'.<br>

   The 'FILTER' function was applied to the column. This allowed quick identification of the oldest customers to youngest customers.

3. Show me the commission total in cell ‘P10’.

   Using the table reference, the 'SUM' function was used to calculate the commision total.
   
Step 1- Multiplication of the two required columns for the subsequent step.

4. Show me the average commission in cell ‘P11’.<br>

   The ‘AVERAGE’ function was utilised.

5. Show the individuals into their specific age groups (Senior, Young Adult and Adult) based on their age.<br>

   An age group column was first added to the dataset to then perform the subsequent function.

   'Nested IF' Formatting was utilised to specify the individuals.

6. Identify the total sales and product category for each transaction ID.<br>

   The table from the 'transactions' sheet was moved to the 'retail_sales_dataset' sheet. This ensures it is easier to find the specified data as the dataset which contains the values is to the left of the table.
